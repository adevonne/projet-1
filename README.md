_**How to play :**_
You are a developper with 0 experience, to gain experience you have to click on the image at the center of your screen (a cat by default). Once you reach 15 exp you can buy your first coding language, HTML, each HTML purchased will give you 1 exp every 10 seconds, the more you buy the easier it will be to unlock the next language. Each language is gradually more expensive, your goal is to buy every language to reach 1 million points and unlock the DEV upgrade meaning you got enough experience to be considered a real DEV.
